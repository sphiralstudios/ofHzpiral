Hzpiral using openFrameworks for iOS and Faust frameworks. 

Final Project for 256A

Hzpiral is a playable pitch-space in polar coordinates, with chroma corresponding to theta and pitch height corresponding to radius.  Planned Hzpiral features include polyphony, quantized pitch tuning based on multiple tuning systems, programmable chords, controllable synth and envelope parameters, and over-network control to MIDI and OSC compatible software synths.

Requires openFrameworks for iOS with the following addons: 
- ofxAssets (required for ofxKCTouchGui2),

- ofxKCTouchGui2 (multitouch) *** modified and included, important: move ofcKCTouchGui2 folder to addons folder prior to running ***

Future versions may require:
- ofxFFT (visualization)
- ofxNetwork (future communication to software synths), 
- ofxOsc (future communication to software synths)
- (soon to be added / required) ofxMidi
